Project Description:

Our term project is called PyKidz, where our group will be creating a website that will act as an educational tool that teaches children ages 8 - 13 years old the basic concepts of the programming language Python. My role in this project is to be the community outreach persona, meaning that I will collect the survey data to gather information on what parents and children would like to see in terms of education styles. I will do this by using my resources as someone who babysits children in Hoboken within that age group.
